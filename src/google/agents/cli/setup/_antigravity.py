"""Mirror globally-installed skills into Antigravity's skill directories.

Temporary workaround until `npx skills` fully supports Antigravity's IDE / CLI /
2.0 skill paths. Today `npx skills ... -g` installs global skills into the
canonical ``~/.agents/skills`` store, but Antigravity does not read from there:
the IDE and Antigravity 2.0 read ``~/.gemini/config/skills`` and the Antigravity
CLI reads ``~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills``. This module bridges that gap by
linking each canonical skill into both locations so a global ``agents-cli setup``
makes the skills visible to Antigravity. Once upstream installs to the correct
locations directly, this module can be removed.

Both locations are mirrored ourselves rather than relying on ``npx skills``,
whose global install is currently unreliable (vercel-labs/skills#1362).

Links are directory symlinks, falling back to directory junctions on Windows
(which work without elevation). Links auto-track the canonical store, so updates
to a skill are seen by Antigravity with no re-link needed.
